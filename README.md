# Magist-WBS - Data analysis with SQL 
It is a training project done withing a Data Science Boot Camp at the WBS Coding School https://www.wbscodingschool.com/
It includes analysis of a company database with SQL and Tableau to get answers to certain business questions.

**The task was described in the following way:**

"Eniac company is an online marketplace specialised in Apple compatible accessories. It was founded 10 years ago in Spain and it has since grown and expanded to other neighbouring countries. Besides offering a wide catalog of products at competitive prices, Eniac provides friendly and professional tech support and consultation to their customers. The warmhearted spirit that thrives with direct contact with the customers is at the roots of the company.

Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. Data shows that Brazil has an eCommerce revenue similar to that of Spain and Italy: an already huge market with an even bigger potential for growth. The problem, for Eniac, is the lack of knowledge of such market. The company doesn’t have ties with local providers, package delivery services or customer service agencies. Creating these ties and knowing the market would take a lot of time, while the board of directors has demanded the expansion to happen within the next year.

Here comes Magist. Magist is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralised order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. Magist is already a big player and allows small companies to benefit from its economies of scale: it has signed advantageous contracts with the marketplaces and with the Post Office, thus reducing the cost in fees and, most importantly, the bureaucracy involved to get things started.

Eniac sells through its own e-commerce store in Europe, with its own site and direct providers for all the steps of the supply chain. In Brazil, however, Eniac is considering signing a 3-year contract with Magist and operating through external marketplaces as an intermediate step, while it tests the market, creates brand awareness and explores the option of opening its own Brazilian marketplace.

The economic conditions of the deal are already being discussed. But not everyone in the company is happy moving on with this. There are two main concerns:

1. Eniac’s catalog is 100% tech products, and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that the marketplaces Magist works with are a good place for these high-end tech products.
2. Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?

Thankfully, Magist has allowed Eniac to access a snapshot of their database. The data might have the answer to these concerns. Here’s where you come in: you will be the one exploring Magist’s database. On Friday, you will meet the board of directors and expose your recommendations."

Apart from certain questions described as comments in the SQL files the task was to draw a **general conclusion** about the feasibility of the contract with Magist company. The results were asked to be delivered as a **presentation**.
